I'm Yixiao HUANG (Chinese name: 黄一笑) and I'm a first-year PhD student at UC Berkeley EECS supervised by [Prof. Somayeh Sojoudi](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/sojoudi.html). I'm interested in establishing the theoretical foundations for language models to enhance their efficiency and reliability. My research aims to strike a balance between rigorous theoretical frameworks and thorough empirical analysis. 

I received my Bachelor's degree in Informaton Engineering in June, 2023 from [Department of Electrical Engineering](https://www.ee.cityu.edu.hk/), City University of Hong Kong. I was fortunate to work with [Prof. Rosa CHAN](https://cityucompuneurolab.github.io/rosa.html) who patiently guided me to start my research adventure. I also had a great time at University of Michigan, working with [Prof. Samet Oymak](https://intra.ece.ucr.edu/~oymak/index.html) on the theoretical foundations of self-attention and hybrid models.
